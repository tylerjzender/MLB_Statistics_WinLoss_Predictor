# MLB_Statistics_WinLoss_Predictor
An evaluation of a number of MLB pitching stats to building an optimal linear regression model. Modeling techniques involve multiple linear regression, dummy variables, interaction terms with predictors, polynomial terms with predictors, a number of transformations, and stepwise algorithms for predictor evaluation. Model evaluation techniques include LOOCV-RMSE, R^2, Adjusted R^2, colinearity, tests for heteroscedasticity, tests for normality, and utilizing traning and testing datasets.
