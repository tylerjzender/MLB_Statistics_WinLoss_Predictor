# MLB_Statistics_WinLoss_Predictor
An evaluation of a number of MLB pitching stats to building an optimal linear regression model. Modeling techniques involve multiple linear regression, dummy variables, interaction terms with predictors, polynomial terms with predictors, a number of transformations, and stepwise algorithms for predictor evaluation. Model evaluation techniques include LOOCV-RMSE, R^2, Adjusted R^2, colinearity, tests for heteroscedasticity, tests for normality, and utilizing traning and testing datasets.

This report and code was developed as a final group project for the course "Statistical Methods in R" as a part of my Masters of Science in Computer Science for the University of Illinois. My contribution to the report and overall project lies mainly in some of the methods section, as well as the entierty of the results section and a preliminary version of the discussion section.
